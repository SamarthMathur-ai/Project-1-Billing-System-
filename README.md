# Retail Billing and Inventory System

This is a simple Java console application for managing a small retail shop's inventory and billing. It allows the user to keep track of products, update their details, and create customer bills. The project uses CSV files to store and load data so that the inventory and bill records are preserved between runs.

## Overview

The application helps a shopkeeper or store manager:

- Add, update, and delete products in the inventory
- Create bills for customers by selecting products and quantities
- Save each customer bill as a CSV file with a date and time stamp
- Automatically update the inventory based on sales
- Prevent billing if a product has insufficient stock

All of this works from the terminal using simple menu options.

## Features

- Load product inventory from a CSV file
- Add new products with name, price, and quantity
- Update product details like price or quantity
- Delete products from the inventory
- Generate bills for customers
- Each bill is saved as a separate CSV file with the customer's name and current date
- Inventory updates after billing
- Input checks for invalid entries
- Handles missing or incorrect CSV lines without crashing
